# List of IaaS Services in Azure and Why They Come Under IaaS

## 1. Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)
- **What It Is:** Azure VMs are like virtual computers that you can use just like physical ones. You can install software, run applications, and store data on them.
- **Why IaaS:** VMs are considered IaaS because you don’t need to worry about the physical hardware; Azure manages that for you. You have control over the virtual machine and can use it as you need.

## 2. Azure Virtual Network (VNet)
- **What It Is:** Azure Virtual Network lets you create private networks in the cloud, just like you would in a physical office.
- **Why IaaS:** VNets are IaaS because you can set up and manage your network without dealing with physical network equipment. Azure takes care of the underlying hardware.

## 3. Azure Load Balancer
- **What It Is:** Azure Load Balancer helps distribute traffic across multiple virtual machines to ensure your applications run smoothly and are always available.
- **Why IaaS:** Load Balancer is IaaS because Azure handles the traffic distribution and underlying hardware for you. You just configure how you want the traffic to be managed.

## 4. Azure Disk Storage
- **What It Is:** Azure Disk Storage provides different types of virtual disks (like hard drives) that you can attach to your virtual machines to store data.
- **Why IaaS:** Disk Storage is IaaS because it gives you virtual storage that you can manage without dealing with physical disks. Azure handles the hardware, and you use the virtual disks as needed.

## 5. Azure Blob Storage
- **What It Is:** Azure Blob Storage is a service for storing large amounts of unstructured data, like documents, images, and videos.
- **Why IaaS:** Blob Storage is IaaS because it provides virtual storage that is highly scalable and cost-effective. You don’t need to worry about the physical storage hardware, as Azure manages it for you.

## 6. Azure Backup
- **What It Is:** Azure Backup is a service that provides reliable backup solutions for your virtual machines and other resources.
- **Why IaaS:** Azure Backup is IaaS because it automates and manages the backup process, ensuring your data is protected without the need for physical backup hardware.

## 7. Azure Site Recovery
- **What It Is:** Azure Site Recovery helps ensure business continuity by replicating your workloads to Azure or another data center in case of a disaster.
- **Why IaaS:** Site Recovery is IaaS because it provides virtual disaster recovery solutions, replicating and managing workloads without the need for physical recovery infrastructure.

## 8. Azure Firewall
- **What It Is:** Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources.
- **Why IaaS:** Azure Firewall is IaaS because it provides a virtualized network security solution. Users can manage and configure firewall rules without dealing with physical firewall hardware.

## 9. Azure Bastion
- **What It Is:** Azure Bastion is a service that provides secure and seamless RDP and SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly through the Azure portal.
- **Why IaaS:** Azure Bastion is IaaS because it offers a virtualized solution for secure remote access to VMs. Users don't need to set up and maintain physical bastion hosts.

## 10. Azure DNS
- **What It Is:** Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains, providing name resolution using Microsoft Azure infrastructure.
- **Why IaaS:** Azure DNS is IaaS because it provides a virtualized DNS service. Users can manage DNS zones and records without maintaining physical DNS servers.

## 11. Azure Dedicated Host
- **What It Is:** Azure Dedicated Host provides physical servers that host one or more Azure virtual machines, offering server-level isolation.
- **Why IaaS:** Azure Dedicated Host is IaaS because it provides dedicated physical servers for running VMs. Users have control over the server and can manage the VMs running on it.

## 12. Azure ExpressRoute
- **What It Is:** Azure ExpressRoute lets you create private connections between Azure data centers and your on-premises infrastructure or colocation environment.
- **Why IaaS:** Azure ExpressRoute is IaaS because it provides a virtualized private network connection. Users can manage the connection settings and bandwidth without dealing with physical network infrastructure.

## Conclusion
These Azure services are considered IaaS because they provide virtualized computing, storage, and networking resources that you can manage and scale according to your needs. Azure handles the physical infrastructure, giving you flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency while allowing you to focus on your applications and workloads.
