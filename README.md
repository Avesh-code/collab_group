# List of IaaS Services in Azure and Why They Come Under IaaS

## 1. Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)
- **Description:** Azure VMs provide scalable computing resources on demand. Users can create, configure, and manage VMs running various operating systems, including Windows and Linux.
- **Why IaaS:** VMs are virtualized computing resources that allow users to run applications without managing the underlying physical hardware. They offer flexibility, scalability, and control over the operating system and applications, which are key characteristics of IaaS.

## 2. Azure Virtual Network (VNet)
- **Description:** Azure Virtual Network enables users to create isolated networks in the cloud. Users can define subnets, route tables, and network security groups to control traffic flow.
- **Why IaaS:** VNets provide virtualized networking resources, allowing users to manage and configure network settings without dealing with physical network infrastructure. This aligns with the IaaS model of providing virtualized infrastructure components.

## 3. Azure Load Balancer
- **Description:** Azure Load Balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple VMs to ensure high availability and reliability of applications.
- **Why IaaS:** Load Balancer is a virtualized service that manages traffic distribution and improves application performance and availability. It abstracts the complexity of physical load balancing hardware, fitting the IaaS model.

## 4. Azure Disk Storage
- **Description:** Azure Disk Storage offers various types of managed disks (Standard HDD, Standard SSD, and Premium SSD) for storing data persistently and securely.
- **Why IaaS:** Disk Storage provides virtualized storage resources that are scalable, durable, and managed by Azure. Users can attach these disks to VMs, managing their storage needs without dealing with physical storage hardware.

## 5. Azure Blob Storage
- **Description:** Azure Blob Storage is an object storage solution optimized for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as documents, images, videos, and backups.
- **Why IaaS:** Blob Storage offers virtualized storage that is highly scalable and cost-effective. It abstracts the physical storage infrastructure, allowing users to focus on managing their data.

## 6. Azure Backup
- **Description:** Azure Backup provides simple and reliable backup solutions for VMs, SQL databases, and other Azure resources.
- **Why IaaS:** Azure Backup is a virtualized service that automates and manages backup processes, ensuring data protection without the need for physical backup hardware.

## 7. Azure Site Recovery
- **Description:** Azure Site Recovery helps in ensuring business continuity by replicating workloads running on VMs to Azure or a secondary data center.
- **Why IaaS:** Site Recovery provides virtualized disaster recovery solutions, replicating and managing workloads without the need for physical recovery infrastructure.

## 8. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **Description:** AKS is a managed Kubernetes service for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes.
- **Why IaaS:** AKS provides virtualized container orchestration, managing the underlying infrastructure required to run containers. It abstracts the complexity of physical container management hardware.

## Conclusion
These Azure services come under IaaS because they provide virtualized computing, storage, and networking resources that users can manage and scale according to their needs. IaaS abstracts the physical infrastructure, offering flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency while allowing users to focus on their applications and workloads.
