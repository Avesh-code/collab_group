# List of PaaS Services in Azure and Why They Come Under PaaS

## 1. Azure App Service
- **Description:** Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps, mobile apps, and API apps.
- **Why PaaS:** App Service abstracts the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on building and deploying applications without worrying about server management, scaling, or maintenance.

## 2. Azure SQL Database
- **Description:** Azure SQL Database is a managed relational database service that offers high performance, scalability, and security.
- **Why PaaS:** SQL Database abstracts the complexities of database management, including patching, backups, and scaling, allowing users to focus on application development.

## 3. Azure Functions
- **Description:** Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables users to run event-driven code without managing infrastructure.
- **Why PaaS:** Functions abstracts the infrastructure management, allowing developers to run code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers.

## 4. Azure Logic Apps
- **Description:** Azure Logic Apps is a cloud service that helps users automate workflows and integrate applications, data, and services.
- **Why PaaS:** Logic Apps provides a visual designer and pre-built connectors, abstracting the underlying infrastructure and enabling users to create complex workflows without writing extensive code.

## 5. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **Description:** AKS is a managed Kubernetes service for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes.
- **Why PaaS:** AKS abstracts the complexities of Kubernetes management, including deployment, scaling, and operations, allowing developers to focus on their containerized applications.

## 6. Azure Cosmos DB
- **Description:** Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service that offers low latency and high availability.
- **Why PaaS:** Cosmos DB abstracts the underlying database infrastructure, providing automated scaling, replication, and management, enabling developers to focus on their data models and application logic.

## 7. Azure Service Fabric
- **Description:** Azure Service Fabric is a distributed systems platform that simplifies the packaging, deployment, and management of scalable and reliable microservices.
- **Why PaaS:** Service Fabric abstracts the complexities of microservices orchestration, providing built-in high availability, scalability, and resource management.

## 8. Azure API Management
- **Description:** Azure API Management is a service that enables users to create, publish, secure, and analyze APIs.
- **Why PaaS:** API Management provides a managed environment for building and deploying APIs, abstracting the underlying infrastructure and offering features like security, monitoring, and analytics.

## 9. Azure SignalR Service
- **Description:** Azure SignalR Service is a fully managed service for adding real-time web functionalities to applications.
- **Why PaaS:** SignalR Service abstracts the complexities of real-time messaging infrastructure, enabling developers to add real-time communication features without managing servers or scaling.

## 10. Azure DevOps
- **Description:** Azure DevOps provides developer services for CI/CD, version control, project management, and testing.
- **Why PaaS:** DevOps offers a managed environment for the entire software development lifecycle, abstracting the underlying infrastructure and providing tools for continuous integration and delivery.

## Conclusion
These Azure services come under PaaS because they provide a platform for building, deploying, and managing applications without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. PaaS abstracts the complexities of infrastructure management, offering scalability, high availability, and integrated development tools, allowing users to focus on their applications and business logic.
