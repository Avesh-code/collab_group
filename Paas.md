# List of PaaS Services in Azure and Why They Come Under PaaS

## 1. Azure App Service
- **What It Is:** Azure App Service is a platform for building and hosting web apps, mobile apps, and APIs without having to manage the servers.
- **Why PaaS:** It takes care of the underlying infrastructure, so developers can focus on their apps instead of worrying about server maintenance, scaling, or updates.

## 2. Azure SQL Database
- **What It Is:** Azure SQL Database is a managed database service that provides high performance and security for your applications.
- **Why PaaS:** It handles database management tasks like patching, backups, and scaling, allowing users to focus on developing their applications.

## 3. Azure Functions
- **What It Is:** Azure Functions is a service that lets you run small pieces of code in response to events without managing servers.
- **Why PaaS:** It abstracts the infrastructure, so developers can simply write code and let Azure handle the rest, including scaling and maintenance.

## 4. Azure Logic Apps
- **What It Is:** Azure Logic Apps is a service that helps you automate workflows and integrate different applications and services.
- **Why PaaS:** It provides a visual designer and pre-built connectors, allowing users to create workflows without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

## 5. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **What It Is:** AKS is a managed service for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes.
- **Why PaaS:** It simplifies Kubernetes management, allowing developers to focus on their applications while Azure takes care of the infrastructure and scaling.

## 6. Azure Cosmos DB
- **What It Is:** Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed database service that offers low latency and high availability.
- **Why PaaS:** It manages the database infrastructure, including scaling and replication, so developers can focus on their data and application logic.

## 7. Azure Service Fabric
- **What It Is:** Azure Service Fabric is a platform for building and managing scalable and reliable microservices.
- **Why PaaS:** It handles the complexities of microservices orchestration, providing high availability and scalability without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure.

## 8. Azure API Management
- **What It Is:** Azure API Management is a service for creating, publishing, securing, and analyzing APIs.
- **Why PaaS:** It provides a managed environment for APIs, abstracting the infrastructure and offering features like security and monitoring.

## 9. Azure SignalR Service
- **What It Is:** Azure SignalR Service is a service for adding real-time web functionalities to your applications.
- **Why PaaS:** It abstracts the complexities of real-time messaging infrastructure, allowing developers to add real-time communication features without managing servers.

## 10. Azure DevOps
- **What It Is:** Azure DevOps provides tools for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), version control, project management, and testing.
- **Why PaaS:** It offers a managed environment for the entire software development lifecycle, allowing developers to focus on their code and applications.

## 11. Azure Batch
- **What It Is:** Azure Batch is a service that enables large-scale parallel and high-performance computing applications to be run efficiently in the cloud.
- **Why PaaS:** Azure Batch abstracts the underlying infrastructure, allowing users to focus on their compute jobs without worrying about managing and scaling virtual machines.

## 12. Azure Stream Analytics
- **What It Is:** Azure Stream Analytics is a real-time analytics service that can process and analyze fast-moving streams of data from various sources.
- **Why PaaS:** Stream Analytics provides a managed environment for real-time data processing, abstracting the complexities of infrastructure management and allowing users to focus on defining their data processing logic.

## 13. Azure Event Grid
- **What It Is:** Azure Event Grid is a service that allows for the management of events in a unified, scalable, and serverless event routing service.
- **Why PaaS:** Event Grid abstracts the infrastructure needed to manage events, providing a fully managed service that allows developers to focus on building event-driven applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

## Conclusion
These Azure services are considered PaaS because they provide platforms for building, deploying, and managing applications without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. PaaS handles the complexities of infrastructure management, offering scalability and high availability, so users can focus on their applications.
